This comprehensive study utilized advanced computational methods to understand how these structures behave under earthquake loads and identify key factors that influence their performance.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="the-journey">The Journey&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The path to this recognition has been anything but easy. After years in the professional world, returning to formal education presented its own set of challenges. However, the decision to leave Chile nearly two years agoâ€”leaving behind our families, friends, and everything familiar to start a new chapter in Canadaâ€”added another layer of complexity to this journey.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introducing CareerCanvas: A Modern Hugo Theme for Technical Portfolios</title><link>https://muhammad-sulaiman.com/blog/careercanvas-hugo-theme/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://muhammad-sulaiman.com/blog/careercanvas-hugo-theme/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to announce the release of CareerCanvas, a modern and responsive Hugo theme designed specifically for technical professionals and engineers.

Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s possibleâ€”and I developed it! At &lt;a href="https://obralink.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ObraLink&lt;/a>, I led the design and implementation of a new functionality that automatically analyzes slab deflections in real-time using BIM data and sensors. No manual modeling. No delays. Just key structural information, precisely when needed.&lt;/p>
